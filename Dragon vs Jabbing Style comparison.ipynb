    "I was wondering which of the two style paths has a higher damage output. Assuming that all my attacks hit clearly the answer was the jabbing style. However, most of the jabbing damage comes from the later attacks, which are less likely to hit, whereas dragon style leads to more damage on your first attack. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then I decided to challenge myself, because I did not want to do the computation with a fixed armor class, but (more realistically I hoped) specifying the challenge rating of the opponent averaging over the distribution of armor classes. This functionality has been exported to the monster.py module. \n",
