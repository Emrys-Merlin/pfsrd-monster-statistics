# Pathfinder Monster Statistics

I wanted to compute my average damage given a challenge rating. For this I needed some distributions concerning armor class given challenge rating and in the end I started to plug a lot of things together and decided to put it in this repository.

## Getting started

1. Download the Excel containing the monster statistics under [this URL](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1StTeUz_ZBU3pNlW120msjUX34p9cs7kqQbZ2Ym7cSBE/edit#gid=125506564) (This is _not_ my work. As far as I know thanks should go out to John Reyst, who generated the sheet). You should use the .xlsx format for the download. It might be that you first need to create a copy of the sheet in your own google account.
